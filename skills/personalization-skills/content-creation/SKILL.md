# Content Configuration Skill

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks for content suggestions during Step 3 of the
Campaign Configuration Wizard. Trigger phrases include:

- "Generate content for all spots"
- "Write a more urgent headline for loyalty members on the hero banner"
- "Create personalized variants for the homepage spots"
- "Suggest content for cart abandoners"
- Any request to generate or modify content for web personalization spots

## Input Context

You will receive:
- Campaign brief JSON (campaign name, objective, business goal, offer details)
- Pages configuration: list of pages with their configured spots (pageId, pageName, spotId, spotName, spotType, selector)
- Available segments/audiences list (names and IDs from Step 2)
- Optionally: existing content configuration (to fill missing fields only, do not overwrite user edits)

## Output Schema

Return a JSON object matching the ContentConfiguration structure:

```jsonc
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "pageId": "string — MUST match an existing page ID from Pages step",
      "pageName": "string",
      "pageUrlPattern": "string — URL pattern from Pages step",
      "spots": [
        {
          "spotId": "string — MUST match an existing spot ID from Pages step",
          "spotName": "string",
          "spotType": "string — e.g., CONTAINER, IMAGE, CTA, HEADING",
          "selector": "string — CSS selector from Pages step",
          "targetingMode": "default_only | segment_variants",
          "defaultVariant": {
            "headline": "string — under 10 words",
            "body": "string — under 30 words",
            "ctaText": "string — under 4 words",
            "imageUrl": "string — image URL or empty",
            "deepLinkUrl": "string — link destination or empty"
          },
          "variants": [
            {
              "variantId": "string — unique ID, prefix with var-new- for new variants",
              "audienceType": "segment",
              "audienceName": "string — MUST match a segment name from Step 2",
              "audienceRefId": "string — segment ID from Step 2",
              "priority": 1,
              "content": {
                "headline": "string",
                "body": "string",
                "ctaText": "string",
                "imageUrl": "string",
                "deepLinkUrl": "string"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Format

Wrap the JSON in a `content-configuration-json` code fence:

````
```content-configuration-json

  "pages": [
    {
      "pageId": "page-abc123",
      "pageName": "Homepage",
      "pageUrlPattern": "https://example.com/",
      "spots": [
        {
          "spotId": "spot-hero-1",
          "spotName": "Hero Banner",

                "deepLinkUrl": "/rewards"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

## Quality Rules

1. **Page/spot IDs must match**: Only include pages and spots that exist in the provided Pages configuration. Never invent new page or spot IDs.
2. **Segment names must match**: Only use segment names and IDs from the provided segments list. Never invent segment names.
3. **Always include a defaultVariant**: Every spot must have a complete defaultVariant (applies to all visitors).
4. **Recommend 1–3 top pages**: If there are many pages, prioritize based on the campaign brief:
   - Conversion campaign → Homepage hero, PDP promo
   - Cart recovery → Cart page, mini-cart, homepage banner
   - Category push → Category page carousel, PDP module
5. **Create 0–3 variants per spot**: Only create segment variants if the campaign implies targeting. Use `targetingMode: "default_only"` if no segment targeting is needed for a spot.
6. **Copy constraints**: Headlines under 10 words, body under 30 words, CTA under 4 words.
7. **Tailor to spot type**: Consider the spot's type and location when generating content (hero banner gets prominent messaging, sidebar gets secondary offers, etc.).
8. **Preserve user edits**: If existing content configuration is provided, only fill in empty/missing fields. Do not overwrite content that the user has already edited.
